# Changelog

## March 22, 2024 - Sharp Rustic 0.0.1

- Engine considers the evaluation of opponent move sequences when chosing the move.
  Root analysis now records the entire forced reply sequence.
- Iterative deepening output lists full sharp lines.

## January 21, 2024 - Rustic Alpha 3.0.5

Version 3.0.5 is a maintenance release. Its main 'feature' is having
dropped separate material counting, by moving the material values directly
into the PSQT's. This is done so that these PSQT's can be used as a basis
for the upcoming Rustic 4. That way, it can be determined how much playing
playing strength is added in Rustic 4 by tapering and tuning these tables.

- Unified the material values with the PSQT values the same way Rustic
  4-beta does. This does not impact playing strength of Alpha 3.
- Update 'clap' to 4.4.18
- Update 'crossbeam-channel' to 0.5.11
- Remove 'crossbeam-utils' (automatically pulled in)

## December 28, 2023 - Rustic Alpha 3.0.4

  failing to compile.

## June 18, 2021 - Rustic Alpha 3.0.0

- New features:
  - Killer Moves
  - Principal Variation Search (PVS)
- Changes:
  - Switch versioning scheme to SemVer. Versions are going to be in the
    form "a.b.c" from now on, with the following meaning:
    - Increment **a**: A new strength-gaining feature was added.
    - Increment **b**: A bug was fixed that gained strength.
    - Increment **c**: A feature was added or a bug was fixed that did not
      gain stregnth. It is not necessary to test this version for a rating
      change.
- Misc:
  - Updated crossbeam-channel to version 0.5.1
  - A Makefile was added, so Rustic can be built using "GNU Make". When
    typing "make" (or "gmake" in MacOS), the Makefile will build all Rustic
    versions for the platform it's being compiled on.
  - Re-add showing the size of the TT and number of threads in About.
  - Fairly large update of the book on https://rustic-chess.org/.
